## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
```
- VPC is a logically isolated virtual network inside AWS.
- It allows you to launch AWS resources in a private network.
- It is isolated from other VPCs within AWS.
- Default limit: 5 VPCs per region (can be increased).
- Default limit: 200 subnets per VPC (can be increased).
- When a VPC is created:
  • A main route table is created.
  • A default Network ACL is created.
  • A default Security Group is created.
  • A default DHCP options set is associated.

- After creating a VPC, you cannot change the primary CIDR block.
- However, you can add secondary CIDR blocks.
- Subnets within a VPC cannot overlap.

```

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
```
- DHCP automatically assigns IP address, subnet mask,
  default gateway, and DNS server details to instances.

Types of VPC
1. Default VPC
2. Custom VPC
```

## Steps to Create VPC (Public Setup)
```
1. Create VPC
2. Create Subnet
3. Create Internet Gateway (IGW)
4. Attach IGW to VPC
5. Create or Edit Route Table
6. Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway
7. Associate Route Table with subnet
```
##  Subnet
```
- A subnet is a range of IP addresses within a VPC.
- Subnetting divides a larger network into smaller networks.
- One VPC can contain up to 200 subnets (default).
- A subnet is always created in a single Availability Zone.
- Subnetting improves network organization and management.

Types of Subnet
  1. Public Subnet
    - A subnet that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
    - Instances must have a public IP to access the internet.

  2. Private Subnet
    - A subnet that does not have a direct route to IGW.
    - Used for databases and backend applications.
```
## Internet Gateway (IGW)
```
- IGW is a highly available and managed AWS component.
- It enables communication between VPC and the internet.
- Default VPC already has an IGW attached.
- In a custom VPC, you must manually create and attach IGW.
```
## Route Table
```
- A route table contains rules that determine where network traffic is directed.
- Each VPC has a main route table.
- Default limit: 200 route tables per VPC (can be increased).
- Default limit: 50 routes per route table (can be increased).
- Routes can point to:
   • Internet Gateway
   • NAT Gateway
   • VPC Peering
   • VPN
   • Transit Gateway
```
## NAT Gateway
```
- NAT Gateway is deployed in a public subnet.
- It allows instances in private subnets to access the internet.
- It blocks inbound traffic initiated from the internet.
- NAT Gateway requires an Elastic IP.
- It is a managed AWS service.
- You are charged for NAT Gateway and data processing.
- Private instances do not need public IP addresses when using NAT.
- When NAT Gateway is deleted, the Elastic IP remains allocated
  and must be released manually if not required.
```
## Bastion Host
```
- Bastion Host is an EC2 instance in a public subnet.
- It acts as a jump server to access private subnet instances.
- Used mainly for SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows).
- Provides controlled and secure administrative access.
```
## VPC Security
```
1. Security Group
   - Instance-level firewall
   - Stateful
   - Supports only ALLOW rules

2. NACL (Network Access Control List)
   - Subnet-level firewall
   - Stateless
   - Supports ALLOW and DENY rules
```
## Difference between NACL & Security Group

## notes
```
- If traffic is allowed in Security Group, response traffic is automatically allowed (because   it is stateful).
- In NACL, you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound traffic.
```


# VPC Peering

* VPC peering is a network connection between 2 VPCs
* Peering connection

(VPC1 ↔ VPC2 ↔ VPC3)
